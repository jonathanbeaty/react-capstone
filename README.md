# Why Use This App?
This App is designed for Small Business Owners who don't necessarily have the cash flow to pay for a CPA firm to manager their federal and state filing and reporting requirements. Keeping up with your business whilst also managing all tax obligations can be a bit daunting, this app is built to help you as the business owner have one location where it can outline when filings are due, how much you owe, and can store this data. (This is V1, a lot of these items will be coming in later versions)
